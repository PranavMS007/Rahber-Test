# Personalized Learning Path Generator

## Overview
This Python script is designed to generate personalized learning paths for users based on their interests, past course engagements, and performance data. The algorithm takes into account the user's evolving learning goals and ensures privacy in handling user data.

## Features
- **User Interests**: Considers the topics that users are interested in.
- **Past Course Engagements**: Takes into account the courses users have already completed.
- **Performance Data**: Utilizes users' performance in past courses to tailor the learning path.
- **Adaptive Learning Paths**: Updates the recommended courses as users' learning goals evolve.
- **Privacy**: Handles user data with care, ensuring that personal information is protected.

## Approach
The script follows a multi-step process to generate a learning path:

1. **Data Collection**: User data is collected with consent and stored securely.
2. **User Profiling**: A profile is created for each user, detailing their interests, past courses, and performance.
3. **Course Metadata**: A database of courses is maintained, including details such as topics covered, difficulty levels, and prerequisites.
4. **Pathway Generation**:
   - Courses are filtered based on user interests and past engagements.
   - Courses are ranked according to how well they match the user's performance data and learning goals.
   - A learning path is created from the ranked courses, ensuring that prerequisites are met.

## Assumptions
- The script assumes that all necessary user data is provided and accurately reflects the user's preferences and abilities.
- It is presumed that the course metadata is comprehensive and up-to-date.
- The algorithm assumes that users will follow the recommended path in sequence.

## Usage
To use the script, instantiate a `User` object with the relevant data and a list of `Course` objects representing available courses. Call the `generate_learning_path` function to receive a tailored list of course recommendations.

## Example:

user = User(
    user_id='123',
    interests=['Data Analysis', 'Statistics'],
    past_courses=['Intro to Python'],
    performance_data={'Intro to Python': 'A'},
    learning_goals=['Become a data scientist']
)

all_courses = [
    Course(
        course_id='1',
        title='Data Science 101',
        topics=['Data Analysis', 'Statistics'],
        difficulty='Beginner',
        completion_time=10,
        prerequisites=['Intro to Python']
    ),
    # Add more courses as needed
]

learning_path = generate_learning_path(user, all_courses)
for course in learning_path:
    print(course.title)
	
## Future Enhancements :
Integrate with a learning management system to automatically pull user data.
Implement machine learning algorithms to improve course recommendations.
Add support for parallel course enrollments and more complex learning goals.
