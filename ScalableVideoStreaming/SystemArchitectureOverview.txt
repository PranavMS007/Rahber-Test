System Architecture Overview
1. Content Delivery Network (CDN):
Purpose: To cache and deliver video content from edge locations closer to users.
Benefits: Reduces latency and bandwidth costs.

2. Load Balancers:
Purpose: To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or cloud instances.
Benefits: Ensures high availability and distributes load during peak times.

3. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:
Purpose: To dynamically adjust video quality based on userâ€™s internet connection.
Benefits: Provides a smooth viewing experience across different device types and network conditions.

4. Microservices Architecture:
Purpose: To break down the application into smaller, independent services.
Benefits: Facilitates scalability, easier updates, and maintenance.

5. Distributed Database:
Purpose: To store user data, video metadata, and other information.
Benefits: Enhances performance and scalability.

6. Caching Mechanisms:
Purpose: To temporarily store frequently accessed data.
Benefits: Reduces database load and improves response time.

7. Auto-Scaling:
Purpose: To automatically adjust the number of active servers based on the current load.
Benefits: Cost-effective resource utilization and handling of traffic spikes.

8. Quality of Service (QoS) Policies:
Purpose: To prioritize traffic for different types of content and services.
Benefits: Ensures that critical services remain available during high traffic.

9. Redundancy and Failover:
Purpose: To have backup systems in place for key components.
Benefits: Maintains service continuity in case of system failures.

10. Monitoring and Analytics:
Purpose: To track system performance and user engagement.
Benefits: Provides insights for further optimization and troubleshooting.

11. Security:
Purpose: To protect against unauthorized access and attacks.
Benefits: Safeguards user data and maintains trust in the platform.

Assumptions:
The architecture is designed for a global audience with diverse internet connectivity.
It assumes variable traffic loads, with potential spikes during new content releases or live events.
The system prioritizes educational content delivery with minimal buffering and high-quality video.
